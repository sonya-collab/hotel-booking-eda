# Hotel Booking EDA
Exploratory data analysis of hotel bookings, including visualizations and insights on cancellations, stay durations, and seasonal trends.

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a hotel booking dataset available on Kaggle at https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mojtaba142/hotel-booking.
The goal is to explore the structure and behavior of the data, with a focus on understanding patterns in bookings, cancellations, and guest behavior.

This project requires the following Python packages
numpy==1.26.4
matplotlib==3.9.4
seaborn==0.13.2
pandas==2.2.3


Among basic analyses, the following properties were interpreted:
- Influence of seasonality on the dataset
- Total stay length in days
- The biggest number of guests, whose reservation was not canceled
- The influence of reservation lead time on the cancellation rate of bookings
